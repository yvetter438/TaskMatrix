		<li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> All communication between your browser and our servers uses industry-standard TLS/SSL encryption</li>
		<li><strong>Secure OAuth 2.0:</strong> We use Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol to authenticate users, which means we never see or store your Google password</li>
